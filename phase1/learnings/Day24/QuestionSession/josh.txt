1. What are Macro Arguments and Variadic Macros in C++ pre-processors?
    - C++ preprocessor macros can take arguments, 
    allowing for more flexible macro definitions.

    `Example:`
    ```cpp
    #define MAX(a, b) ((a) > (b) ? (a) : (b))
    int larger = MAX(3, 5);  // Expands to: ((3) > (5) ? (3) : (5))
    ```

    - `Variadic macros` allow a variable number of arguments:
    ```cpp
    #define PRINT(...) printf(__VA_ARGS__) // __VA_ARGS__ is used for variable arguments
    PRINT("Hello, %d\n", 42);  // Expands to: printf("Hello, %d\n", 42);

2. How to create the Static Library using ar command?

    The `ar` command to bundle the object file into a static library (`.a` file):
    ```bash
    ar rcs libmathutils.a math_utils.o
    ```

    Here:
    - ``ar``: Archiver utility to create static libraries.
    - ``rcs``: 
    - `r`: Replace or insert files into the archive.
    - `c`: Create the archive if it doesnâ€™t exist.
    - `s`: Add an index for faster lookups.

    The resulting `libmathutils.a` is your static library.

3. Summarize Exception Handling Concepts in C++

    - ``try-catch``: Used to handle exceptions. 
    Code that may throw an exception is enclosed in the `try` block, and 
    any exceptions are caught and handled in the `catch` block.
    - `Multiple `catch` blocks`: You can have more than one `catch` block 
    to handle different types of exceptions separately.
    - `Generic `catch` block`: A `catch` block 
    that catches all types of exceptions using the `...` syntax.
    - `Custom Exceptions`: You can define custom exceptions 
    by inheriting from the `std::exception` class (or any derived class)
    to handle specific errors in your application.
    - `Throwing exceptions`: The `throw` keyword is used 
    to explicitly throw an exception when an error condition is met.

4. What are the Phases of the Waterfall Model?

    1. `Requirement Analysis`
    - `Objective`: Collect and document all the software requirements.
    - `Activities`:
        - Stakeholder discussions to identify needs.
        - Create a detailed `Software Requirement Specification (SRS)` document.
    - `Output`: Clear, documented requirements.

    ---

    2. `System Design`
    - `Objective`: Develop the architecture and design of the system.
    - `Activities`:
        - High-Level Design (HLD): Overall system structure, database design, and data flow.
        - Low-Level Design (LLD): Detailed design of each module or component.
    - `Output`: Design documents, diagrams, and specifications.

    ---

    3. `Implementation (Coding)`
    - `Objective`: Translate the design into actual code.
    - `Activities`:
        - Developers write and integrate code for all modules.
        - Use programming tools and follow coding standards.
    - `Output`: Source code and executable builds.

    ---

    4. `Testing`
    - `Objective`: Identify and fix defects in the system.
    - `Activities`:
        - Unit Testing: Verify individual components.
        - Integration Testing: Test interactions between modules.
        - System Testing: Check overall system functionality.
        - Acceptance Testing: Validate the software against the requirements.
    - `Output`: Tested and defect-free product.

    ---

    5. `Deployment`
    - `Objective`: Deliver the software to the customer for use.
    - `Activities`:
        - Deploy the product to the production environment.
        - Provide training and documentation for users.
    - `Output`: Fully deployed system.

    ---

    6. `Maintenance`
    - `Objective`: Address issues and improve functionality post-deployment.
    - `Activities`:
        - Bug fixing, updates, and enhancements.
        - Performance optimization and support.
    - `Output`: Updated and reliable software.
