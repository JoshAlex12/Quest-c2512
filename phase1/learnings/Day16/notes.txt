    2. Individual comparison functions as non-member functions [friends to class, outside the object functions]
                        -> make (1) as friends
    3. Individual comparison functions as non-member functions [friends to class, outside the object functions]

            comparison functions of hospital stay together in the main function to test 
                        -> include hospital stay
