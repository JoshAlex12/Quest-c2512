Outcomes:

Keys:
    Primary Key
            -> Must be unique
            -> Used to identify the entire row
            -> Cannot contain NULL values.
            -> Each table can have only one primary key
            -> A primary key is basically a type of candidate key

    Super Key
            -> A set of one or more columns that, taken together, can uniquely identify each row in a table
            -> Can use as many combinations which identifes the table uniquely

    Candidate Key
            -> Minimal super key
            -> Minimum number of colums that uniquely represent the table
            -> (Ask Mahesh) can candidate key have null values

    Foreign Key
            -> Can be used to identify a column in another table
            -> It uniquely identifies
            -> It is the primary key in another table

    Composite Key
            -> It is a super key containing two or more columns

    Alternate Key
            -> Any candidate key that is not chosen as the primary key
    
    Unique Key
            -> A column or set of columns that must contain unique values across all rows in the table
            -> The values in the column is to be unique
    
    Secondary Key:
            -> A secondary key is a key or set of columns used to retrieve data from a table.
            -> But it does not need to uniquely identify rows.
            -> Itâ€™s often used for indexing purposes to speed up searches and improve query performance on specific columns.
    
    Surrogate Key:
            -> later

Normal forms:
    -> Initially every DB is Unnormalized Form (UNF)
