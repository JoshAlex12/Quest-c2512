1. Create a new directory called `my_cpp_project` for your C++ programs.

2. Change into the `my_cpp_project` directory.

3. Create a C++ file named `greet.cpp` 
    in the `my_cpp_project` directory.
4. Write a C++ program inside `greet.cpp` 
    that asks the user for their name and prints a greeting message.

5. Compile the `greet.cpp` program into an executable.

6. Run the compiled executable and ensure 
    that it prompts for the user’s name and displays the greeting.

7. Use a Linux command to display the contents of `greet.cpp`.

8. Modify the `greet.cpp` file 
    to add a simple farewell message and save the changes.

9. Compile and run the modified program 
    to ensure it works as expected.

10. Remove the `greet.cpp` file once you're done.

11. Check the contents of the `my_cpp_project` directory, and 
    remove the directory if it’s empty.
