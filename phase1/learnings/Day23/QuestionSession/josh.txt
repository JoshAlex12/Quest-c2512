1. According to Google's C++ Style Guide, what are all the rules to be followed while defining constants and enum?
    
    `Constants`
    - Use `kPascalCase` for constants, prefixed with `k`.
    - Constants should be declared as `constexpr` or `const`.

    `Examples`:
    ```cpp
    constexpr double kPi = 3.14159;
    const int kMaxBufferSize = 1024;

    `Enum Names`
    - Use `PascalCase` for the enum name and `kPascalCase` for the enumerators.

    `Examples`:
    ```cpp
    enum class Color {
        kRed,
        kGreen,
        kBlue
    };

    enum Status {
        kOk,
        kError,
        kUnknown
    };
    ```

2. Explain the Syntax for Creating a Stored Procedure

    ```sql
    CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE procedure_name 
        (parameter1 IN datatype, parameter2 OUT datatype, ...)
    AS
    -- Declaration section (optional)
    BEGIN
    -- Execution section (mandatory)
    -- Your PL/SQL code goes here
    EXCEPTION
    -- Exception handling section (optional)
    END procedure_name;
    ```

3.  Who will access the private members of the object? 
    1. member functions of the object 
        MAHESH RECOMMENDATION: to use getter / setter
    2. friend function (outside the object) of the object 
    3. friend class (another class) of the object
    4. public getter / setter for object private fields/attr 
        MAHESH RECOMMENDATION: to use getter / setter

4. What is shebang in shell scripting?

    #!/path/to/interpreter

    The shebang (#!) is a special character sequence used at the beginning 
    of a script to specify the interpreter that should be used to execute the script. 
    It tells the system how to run the script and what program or shell should process the file.

5. What are the types of inheritance:

    1. single level inheritance: Animal -> Lion 
    2. multi level inheritance: Animal -> Lion -> Cub -> CubLion
    3. multiple inheritance: {Lion, Lioness} -> Cub 
    4. hierachical inheritance: Animal -> Lion, Animal -> Lioness 
    5. hybrid : Animal -> Lion, Animal -> Lioness, {Lion, Lioness} -> Cub
